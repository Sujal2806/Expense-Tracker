## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher

- Git (for version control)

## Installation & Setup

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/expense-tracker.git
   cd expense-tracker
   ```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   export FLASK_APP=app
   export FLASK_ENV=development
   export SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

### Docker Deployment

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t expense-tracker .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 -v $(pwd):/app -v $(pwd)/instance:/app/instance expense-tracker
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:5000`

## Docker Image

The application is available as a Docker image:

```bash
docker pull sujalgp/expense-tracker:latest
docker run -p 5000:5000 sujalgp/expense-tracker:latest
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`.

### Workflow Features

- 🔄 Automatic builds on push to main branch
- 🐳 Docker image building and pushing
- 🏷️ Multiple tags for version tracking
- ⚡ Layer caching for faster builds

### How it Works

1. **Trigger**: The workflow runs on:
   - Push to main branch
   - Pull requests to main branch

2. **Build Process**:
   - Uses Docker Buildx for efficient builds
   - Implements layer caching for faster builds
   - Creates two tags for each build:
     - `latest`
     - Git commit SHA

3. **Docker Hub Integration**:
   - Automatically pushes to Docker Hub
   - Uses secure secrets for authentication
   - Maintains version history

### Setup Requirements

To use the CI/CD pipeline, you need to set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

1. Go to repository Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
2. Add the following secrets:
   - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
   - `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Your Docker Hub access token

### Manual Trigger

You can also manually trigger the workflow:
1. Go to the Actions tab in your repository
2. Select the "CI/CD Pipeline" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
